##  Project Mission:

-  CryptoMarket Scout utilizes CoinGecko's API to gather historical data on several cryptocurrencies

-  We have created interactive visualizations containing price action on various single cryptocurrency coins 

- CryptoMarket Scout provides "Market Snapshots" of the cryptocurrency market that allows the User to access several summary metrics such as daily percentage winners/losers, market cap, total volume, circulating supply, and more.

- We have created tools to allow Users to create their own custom cryptocurrency portfolio. 

- Our models help Users run Monte Carlo simulations on their custom portfolio, calculate measures such as their cumulative returns over time, and Sortino Ratio of their custom portfolio. 

- The dashboards we have built are all publicly displayed and available for use on our Web page published at:  <a href="https://rawnakmahjabib.github.io/CryptoMarket-Scout/">CryptoMarket Scout</a>

## Market Overview

![Market Overview](Market-Overview.png)

- Through the tools we have built, in the first tab of our Dashboard, Users are able to gain information about which coins had the greatest percentage gains/losses over the last 24 hour period, daily volume, market cap, circulating supply & total supply. All visualizations are interactive and user-friendly. 

![Price Action](Price-Action.png)

- The next tab of our Dashboard allows Users the ability to use a dropdown menu to select a coin of their choosing to view historical price action, rolling averages over a specified timeframe of the User's choosing, and momentum. 

![Portfolio Plots](Portfolio-Plots-1.png)

- Currently, Users are able to view various summary metrics of a pre-selected portfolio that is equally weighted. These metrics provide insight to how the portfolio performed as a whole in addition to its individual components.
