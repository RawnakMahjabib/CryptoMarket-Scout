##  Project Mission:

-  CryptoMarket Scout utilizes CoinGecko's API to gather historical data on several cryptocurrencies

-  We have created interactive visualizations containing price action on various single cryptocurrency coins 

- CryptoMarket Scout provides "Market Snapshots" of the cryptocurrency market that allows the User to access several summary metrics such as daily percentage winners/losers, market cap, total volume, circulating supply, and more.

- We have created tools to allow Users to create their own custom cryptocurrency portfolio. 

- Our models help Users run Monte Carlo simulations on their custom portfolio, calculate measures such as their cumulative returns over time, and Sortino Ratio of their custom portfolio. 

- The dashboards we have built are all publicly displayed and available for use on our Web page published at:  <a href="https://rawnakmahjabib.github.io/CryptoMarket-Scout/">CryptoMarket Scout</a>
